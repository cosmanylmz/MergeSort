Array: [16,21,11,8,12,22]

First step
[16, 21, 11, 8, 12, 22] We need to split the array into two parts

2nd step :seperation
[16, 21, 11]    [8, 12, 22]
[16, 21]  [11]    [8, 12]  [22]
[16]  [21]  [11]    [8]  [12]  [22]  We have to divide until the last piece


3rd step merging
[16, 21]  [11]    [8, 12]  [22] Then we have to compare them an then adding them to order 
[11, 16, 21]    [8, 12, 22]
[8, 11, 12, 16, 21, 22]
